Have a Mac? If so, you should actually know Growl. If not - DOWNLOAD IT - ITS AWESOME!
Anyway, I've made something similar in AS2 for iCPro3 and you should have already seen some Notifications ^_^

Anyway, <u>what does it do? Why is it so awesome?</u>
Well, imagine, you were sitting in front of your Computer, waiting for an EMail of a Friend.
It would be lame to check every 5 minutes if it has arrived, therefore some smart People invented Growl.
Its an App for Mac that adds Notifications to your Desktop. Whenever something happens, it tells you.
For Example when somebody wants to add you in Skype, you get a Notification telling you :D

Well, so what does it do in iCPro3? It tells you if you've been muted, if you've received a PM, if you've gotten a Comment on your Profile, Stuff like that, you know?
Its pretty cool, so make sure to check it out.

Soon to come: Preferences and perhaps/unlikely other Skins for it (No really, "Smoke" just looks awesome :P)

Yours,
