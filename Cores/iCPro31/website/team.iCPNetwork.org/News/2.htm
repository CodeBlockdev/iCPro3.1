Hey there, its me - Alex - blogging.
If you ever asked yourself, what would be the coolest Thing when playing such a Game like CP, you might have found out that the Answer is just Awesome:
<b>InGame Social Networking ^_^</b>

Well, you might ask what that is, but its funny:
You are there, playing iCPro3 as usually, and then you get a Notice saying:
"Hey, there is a new Comment on your Profile!"

Its way cooler than having a Browser in the Background that you always have to refresh.
So here it is: <i>InGame Social Networking (IGSNW)</i>

I am still working on the whole Code and Programflow, but currently its looking pretty neat, eh?

Anyway, most likely, I wont Blog to much in this InGame News Feed, but when I do, I will - of course - give you the newest Backstage Info's about iCPro3.

Thats basicly it,
