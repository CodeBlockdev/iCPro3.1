Hey there, it seems like you forgot to specify a file to run?
Hehe, not to bad. Not as if somebody died ;) But still, I recommend
specifying some file to use, otherwise this is just pointless.

To specify a file do this:
  php Main.php FILENAME
  
  If FILENAME was Default.php (and yes, thats it's default value) this screen will appear :)
  Therefore its suggested to put something else in FILENAME ;)
