static final class EventListener()
  (Also usable as System.EventListener *)
  
  EventListener::AddListener(mixed $event, callback $callback[, mixed $id])
    Where $event is the Event Identifier as used in FireEvent
    and   $callback is the Callback, either as array('Class', 'Method'), 'Class::Method', 'Function' or Closure (just to list a few examples)
    and   $id is the Identifier, which is optional. If not passed, it will be automatically generated (Numeric)
    
    Returns:
      An Array with these Elements
      0     => ID of the Callback
      key   => ID of the Callback
      1     => Callback itself
      value => Callback itself
    
  EventListener::RemoveListener(mixed $event, callback $callback)
    Where $event is the Event Identifier as used in FireEvent
    and   $callback is either the Callback (just Array or String) to delete or the ID of the Callback (all types of Callback)
    
    Attention! When you want to delete a Closure, you HAVE TO pass the ID! Comparing Closures in PHP as of Mai, 5th 2010 does NOT work
    
  EventListener::FireEvent(mixed $event)
    Its a bit obvious
  
  * Notice:
  In PHP you can 'always' write Blah.Blah.Class::Method
  The only difference is, instead of an Array System.EventListener::AddListener(123, 'MyTest') returns 'SystemArray'.
  Therefore Results of Blah.Class::Method are pretty useless (unless the Method returns a String, and you want to waste CPU by Substringing)
  Further, its not recommended as it takes more CPU
  
  By the way, for those who care; this is how it works:
  '.' in PHP is the String Append Operator, thats why 'System.EventListener' is the same as '"System" . EventListener'
  Why 'System' equals to '"System"'? Because its (most likly ;)) an undefined Constant, which is in PHP the same as using a String
